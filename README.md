# UBER Ride Booking Data Analysis Project

This project analyses over **100,000 simulated UBER ride bookings** in Bengaluru to uncover booking trends, cancellations, customer behaviour, and revenue patterns.

## Project Objective
- Understand ride success rates, cancellations, and customer ratings
- Identify revenue patterns and peak demand periods

## Tools Used
- **SQL** â€” Data analysis and querying
- **Power BI** â€” Dashboard creation
- **Excel** â€” Data cleaning

## Key Insights
- **62% ride success rate**, with cancellations mostly due to driver or customer issues
- Bookings rise **~30% on weekends and match days**
- **Cash and UPI** are top payment methods
- Average customer and driver ratings are near **4.0**

## Final Analysis
- Analysed 100K+ UBER ride records using SQL & Power BI to identify booking success rate (62%), cancellation patterns (7% by customers, 18% by drivers), and peak demand periods
- Built 10+ SQL queries and 5+ Power BI dashboards to visualise booking trends, cancellation reasons, and customer-driver ratings.
- Derived insights on revenue impact of weekends & match days, highlighting up to 30% higher bookings during peak periods.
- Optimised reporting by creating SQL views for top customers, vehicle-wise ride distances, and incomplete ride reasons.
