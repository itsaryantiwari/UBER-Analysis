# UBER Ride Booking Data Analysis Project

This project simulates and analyses over **1,00,000+ UBER ride booking records** for Bengaluru, focusing on ride success rates, cancellation patterns, customer behaviour, and revenue trends.

## Project Objective

To perform comprehensive data analysis on UBER ride booking data to extract actionable business insights related to operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue optimisation.

## Key Highlights

- Generated a synthetic dataset with realistic booking constraints:
  - **62% success rate**
  - **<7% customer cancellations**
  - **<18% driver cancellations**
- Conducted SQL-based analysis to uncover:
  - Booking patterns and success rates
  - Top customers and ride distances by vehicle type
  - Common reasons for cancellations and incomplete rides
  - Revenue trends and booking volumes during peak periods (weekends, match days)
- Developed **10+ SQL queries** and created **Power BI dashboards** for data visualization:
  - Booking Status Breakdown
  - Revenue by Payment Method
  - Customer vs. Driver Ratings
  - Peak Demand Analysis

## Data Analysis Approach

- Data Cleaning and Validation
- SQL Queries for Data Exploration
- Creation of SQL Views for optimised reporting
